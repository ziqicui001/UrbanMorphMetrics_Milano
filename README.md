## Introduction

This project aims to quantify the morphological indicators of Milan through Momepy, showing the whole process from data input to calculation and obtaining the results of each indicator. Momepy is a library for quantitative analysis of urban form - urban morphometrics. It is part of PySAL (Python Spatial Analysis Library) and is built on top of GeoPandas, other PySAL modules and networkX.
